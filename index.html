      <h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
      <p>
        Fitness, by definition, is the condition of being physically fit and
        healthy. It involves activity of some sort that stimulates various
        systems of the body and maintains a certain condition within the body.
        Being fit not only means physical health, but emotional and mental
        health, too. It defines every aspect of your health. Smart eating and
        active living are fundamental to fitness.

      <p>
        Fitness includes five essential components. These are flexibility,
        cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, muscular strength, and
        body composition. Fitness is vitally important to health and wellness as
        well as the ability to engage in normal activities of daily living
        without excessive fatigue. Physical activity and exercise training
        programs should be designed with the intent of improving each of the key
        components of health-related physical fitness in addition to preventing
        chronic disease (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, etc.)
